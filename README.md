# RealEstateWebsite-CMS-Exam-Project
This page is connected to my headless CMS Obsidian which is the website that makes API requests to the db which I alter using the cms.
Lillard & Co was built using React, Vite & TailwindCss. Feel free to explore it!

** The code behind this project is in a private repo, for interest in viewing the code feel free to ask me, and I'll invite you to the repository **

This is my exam project called Obsidian. I built a headless cms for a fictional Real Estate Agency called "Lillard & Co". The idea behind this cms was to give the owner and employees of Lillard & Co a way to manage their real estate listings, and by using Obsidian they will be able to CRUD their data. This project was later converted into a desktop app using Electron.js.
